  "description": "Fair coin flipping over a quantum channel: Alice and Bob each contribute randomness via entanglement.",
  "long_description": "Quantum coin flipping uses entanglement to achieve a fair coin flip between two mutually distrustful parties. Unlike classical coin flipping, neither party can bias the outcome without being detected. A Bell pair is shared; each party applies a random local operation, then both measure. The XOR of their results is the coin. Full security requires a more complex protocol; this circuit demonstrates the core idea.",
